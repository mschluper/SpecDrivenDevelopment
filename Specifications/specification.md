# Family Shopping Application Specification

## Purpose

The Family Shopping Application exists to simplify multi-store shopping by providing a centralized system for managing product inventories and shopping needs across multiple retail locations. The application eliminates the inefficiency of visiting stores that don't carry needed items and optimizes shopping trips by showing product availability across all tracked stores.

## Application Pages

### Dashboard
**Purpose**: Serves as the primary interface for managing immediate shopping needs and planning store visits based on product availability.

The Dashboard provides users with a streamlined workflow for adding products to their shopping list and determining the most efficient stores to visit based on product availability coverage.

### Products  
**Purpose**: Manages the master inventory of all products and their store availability relationships.

The Products page allows users to build and maintain a comprehensive database of products they regularly purchase, specifying which stores carry each item. This creates the foundation for intelligent shopping trip planning.

### Stores
**Purpose**: Maintains the registry of retail locations where shopping occurs.

The Stores page enables users to add, modify, and remove stores from their shopping ecosystem, providing context for product availability tracking.

### Recipes 

**Purpose**: Maintain a collection of recipes and their ingredients. 

The Recipes Page displays all defined recipes in a table, each with their ingredients in a separate column.  Editing a Recipe enables the user to define the recipe name and what products are needed for the recipe (as ingredients). 

## UI Test Specifications

### UI Interaction

Implement proper form validation with clear visual feedback. All form fields should show validation state (valid/invalid) and disable submit buttons until all required fields are properly filled. Create thorough bUnit tests that verify form controls properly update component state and enable/disable related UI elements.

### Dashboard Page Tests

1. **Product Selection Component**: The top component on the Dashboard enables the user to select products from their master list and specify quantities that need to be purchased, without requiring store selection.

2. **Shopping Needs Display**: The main component displays a table showing all products currently needed for purchase, with each product row indicating availability status (available/unavailable) across all tracked stores. This is a core feature.

3. **Store Coverage Analysis**: The shopping needs table includes a footer row that shows for each store what percentage of needed products are available, helping users identify the most efficient shopping destinations. This is a core feature.

4. **Quantity Management**: Users can adjust the quantity of needed items directly in the shopping needs table using increment/decrement controls without navigating to separate forms.

5. **Purchase Completion**: Users can mark individual items as purchased or use a bulk action to clear all purchased items from their active shopping list.

6. **Quick Navigation**: The Dashboard provides direct links to the Products and Admin pages for managing the underlying data when the current inventory is insufficient.

### Products Page Tests

7. **Product Creation**: Users can add new products to their master inventory by specifying the product name, optional notes, and selecting which stores carry the item.

8. **Store Assignment**: During product creation and editing, users can select multiple stores where each product is available, establishing the availability matrix used by the Dashboard.

9. **Product Search and Filtering**: Users can locate specific products in their inventory through text search and category-based filtering to manage large product catalogs efficiently.

10. **Bulk Product Management**: The Products page displays all inventory items in a searchable table format, allowing users to quickly edit product details or remove discontinued items.

### Stores Page Tests

11. **Store Registration**: Users can add new retail locations to their shopping ecosystem by providing store names and any relevant details.

12. **Store Modification**: Existing store information can be updated to reflect name changes, closures, or other relevant details that affect shopping planning.

13. **Store Removal**: Users can remove stores from their system, with appropriate warnings about impact on product availability data.

### Recipes Page Tests

14. **Recipe Creation**: Users can add new recipes by specifying the recipe name, how many people it serves, and selecting which products it requires.

15. **Products Required**: During recipe creation and editing, users can select multiple products that are ingredients. Upon updating the recipe, all its ingredients are persisted.

16. **Filter by Product**: Users can select a product and see what recipes use the selected product as ingredient.

## Core User Workflow

The application supports a three-phase shopping workflow:
1. **Planning Phase**: Users add needed products to their shopping list via the Dashboard
2. **Analysis Phase**: The system displays which stores carry the needed items and calculates coverage percentages
3. **Execution Phase**: Users visit the most efficient stores and mark items as purchased upon completion

This workflow transforms shopping from a reactive, inefficient process into a data-driven, optimized experience that minimizes time spent visiting stores that don't carry needed items.
